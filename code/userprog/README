We have implemented part 1, 2, 4, 5, 6(extra credit). And nearly figure out how to deal with part 3. And we have made some tests on the following aspects:
1. Exec:
	We tested basic Exit("../test/exittest",0, 0, 0), and tested more than one Exec called in the same program (so there will be multithreading). And they all works well.
2. Read & Write:
	We tested the "echo.c" with the Read & Write. And we also tested "snake.c" after increasing the phyNumofPages to 40. Both of them rans well.
3. Exception:
	We implemented various non-system-call exceptions defined by machine.h, as soon as we catch those exceptions, we print exception message and kill the current thread. And we wrote 5 test file to test our code, including both calling directly and calling by "Exec". They all rans well.
4. Join:
	We implemented Join system call and tested it with "jointest.c". And it rans well.

In this project, we four worked together. Lijun Chen implemented Exec, Yiqiu Liu implemented Join, Nasha Zhai implemented Exception, Ruogu Liu implemented Read & Write.
